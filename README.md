# Calculator
A simple calculator program.

Utilizes the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix notation equations (i.e. 1+1) to postfix/Reverse Polish notation to solve the problem.

Uses the Java.AWT GUI framework for the frontend design of the calculator.

The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and negative numbers (decimals implemented later).
