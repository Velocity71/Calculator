# Calculator
A simple calculator program.

Utilizes the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix notation equations (i.e. 1+2) to postfix/Reverse Polish notation (i.e. 12+) to solve the problem.

Uses the Java.AWT GUI framework for the frontend design of the calculator.

The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negative numbers and decimals.

TO USE: 
Download the Calculator.jar file, and ensure you also have the latest JRE or JDK downloaded.
In the terminal, navigate inside the folder you have stored the Calculator.jar file to, and run 'java -cp Calculator.jar Main'. To exit the program press the 'Q' button. Every other button but '%' works like a normal calculator.
