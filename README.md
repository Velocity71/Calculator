# Calculator
A simple calculator program.

Utilizes the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix notation equations (i.e. 1+2) to postfix/Reverse Polish notation (i.e. 12+) to solve the problem.

Uses the Java.AWT GUI framework for the frontend design of the calculator.

The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and negative numbers (decimals implemented later).
